      <p>
        After obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Human Biology, I pursued a
        Master's degree in Bioinformatics. I am passionate about software
        engineering, web development, and data analysis applied to biology. I am
        eager to apply the skills I acquired during my studies and professional
        experiences in a position in bioinformatics.

        This website is one of my personal projects. It showcases my programming
        skills, particularly in HTML and CSS, and is available in French. I have
        included links to the various training programs I participated in, and
        you can contact me through my LinkedIn profile or by email.
