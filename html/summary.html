        After obtaining a Bachelor's degree in Human Biology, I pursued a
        Master's degree in Bioinformatics. I am passionate about software
        engineering, web development, and data analysis applied to biology. I am
        eager to apply the skills I acquired during my studies and professional
        experiences in a software engineering position.
