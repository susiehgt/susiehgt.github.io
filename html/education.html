      My first year allowed me to explore various programming languages. The
      different projects I participated in helped me learn algorithms used in
      biology as well as best practices specific to each language. I contributed
      to several projects in various fields such as web development, software
      development, data analysis, and image processing. For my final year
      project, I also had the opportunity to work on a robotics project, where I
      learned the basics of electronics and hardware programming. I completed my
      internship at EMBL-EBI (Hinxton, United Kingdom).

      After my Scientific Baccalaureate, I chose to enroll in the Bachelor's in
      Health Sciences to broaden my skills in human biology. I also spent a year
      in Erasmus in Slovakia to improve my English. During this year abroad, I
      worked on a biology project aimed at identifying the various
      microorganisms present in the thermal springs of Piešťany. This year was
      culturally and academically enriching as the small class sizes in Slovakia
      allowed for excellent support and numerous opportunities for practical
      work in laboratories.
