          <p>
            As part of my work within the Molecular Networks team at te EMBL-EBI, 
            I have updated the IntAct Cytoscape app to include a new advanced research tool as well
            as a grouping by orthologs view (Update coming soon).

          <p>
            Following my internship at EMBL-EBI, I had the opportunity to remain
            in the molecular networks team to update and enhance the XML Maker.
            This <b>Java</b> application, using the <b>Spring</b> framework, is
            an essential tool for scientific curators, allowing them to generate
            XML files from data provided by laboratories. The first stage of
            this project was the implementation of a formatter that enables
            curators to convert gene and protein names into UniProtKB accession
            numbers. This represents a considerable time-saving for curators who
            previously extracted this data manually. The second stage of this
            project, which is still ongoing, is the redesign of the XML file
            generator to implement the standard PSI-MI formats using an
            appropriate library.

            The European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) includes the
            European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) among its establishments.
            The aim of EBI is to generate and centralise molecular data to make
            it accessible to the public. I had the opportunity to work within
            the team that deals with molecular networks. During my internship at
            the organisation, I had the chance to develop the
            <i>Molecular Complex Navigator</i>, a web tool for visualising and
            comparing protein complexes, available by clicking on this
            <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/complex/search?query=Ndc80&page=1&minConfidence=1&displayMode=navigator-view&mergeOrthologs=false&componentsSorting=Default&idDisplay=true&organismIconDisplay=true&typeIconDisplay=true">
              link
            </a>. This web tool, developed in <b>TypeScript</b> with the
            <b>Angular</b> framework, is both performant and interactive. The
            integration of data such as orthology allows for the comparison of
            complexes across species. This required the addition of new
            references to the Panther database, integrated into our own database
            using
            <a href="https://github.com/EBI-IntAct/intact-data-exchange">code</a>
            in <b>Java</b> utilising the <b>Spring</b> framework. This project
            allowed me to develop my skills in web development and
            communication, particularly through the various presentations I
            delivered (Scientific Advisory Board, EMBL-EBI Protein and Complexes
            Day, HUPO Conference 2024).

              The objective of this project was to construct a fleet of robots
              detected by ArUco markers via an external camera. As part of this
              group project, we modelled the robot using OnShape software, and
              then we assembled the robots. These robots are equipped with an
              ESP32 microcontroller and an L298N driver that allows control of
              two motors.

              My contribution to the project was the implementation of code on
              the microcontroller via the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development
              Environment). This IDE uses the C++ programming language, which is
              geared towards hardware programming. I also developed the website
              to control the robots, using HTML.
